# Architecture Diagram Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the enhanced T-Pot architecture diagram that will be created to visualize the complete system architecture including:

## Diagram Components

### 1. Core Infrastructure
- **Azure VM**: T-Pot honeypot deployment
- **NetBird Network**: Zero-trust network access
- **Security Onion**: Local SIEM instance
- **Elastic Fleet**: Agent-based monitoring

### 2. Network Architecture
- **Internet**: Attack traffic from global sources
- **Honeypot Zone**: Exposed services for attack capture
- **Management Zone**: Secure administrative access
- **Logging Zone**: Secure log transmission
- **Internal Zone**: Internal service communication

### 3. Security Controls
- **Network Segmentation**: Isolated network segments
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access control
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption
- **Monitoring**: Continuous security monitoring

### 4. Data Flow
- **Attack Traffic**: Internet → Honeypot → Logging
- **Management Traffic**: NetBird → Management Interface
- **Log Traffic**: Honeypot → Security Onion
- **Monitoring Traffic**: Elastic Fleet → Security Onion

## Diagram Specifications

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: PNG or SVG
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080
- **Style**: Professional, clean design
- **Colors**: Consistent with security theme

### Content Requirements
- **Clear Labels**: All components clearly labeled
- **Flow Arrows**: Data flow clearly indicated
- **Security Zones**: Different zones clearly distinguished
- **Legend**: Comprehensive legend for all symbols

## Implementation Notes

### Tools for Creation
- **Draw.io**: Free online diagramming tool
- **Lucidchart**: Professional diagramming platform
- **Visio**: Microsoft diagramming software
- **Inkscape**: Free vector graphics editor

### Design Principles
- **Clarity**: Easy to understand at a glance
- **Accuracy**: Technically accurate representation

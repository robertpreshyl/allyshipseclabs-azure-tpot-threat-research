## Screenshot Guidelines

### Technical Requirements
- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080 for clarity
- **File Size**: Maximum 2MB per image
- **Naming**: Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens

### Content Requirements
- **Anonymization**: All sensitive information must be anonymized
- **Clarity**: Screenshots must be clear and readable
- **Context**: Include relevant context and labels
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent styling and formatting

### Privacy and Security
- **No Sensitive Data**: Remove or anonymize all sensitive information
- **No Personal Information**: Ensure no personal information is visible
- **No Credentials**: Remove all passwords, keys, and tokens
- **No IP Addresses**: Anonymize or remove real IP addresses

## Implementation Notes

### Placeholder Comments
The following placeholder comments are used throughout the documentation:

```markdown
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of NetBird dashboard showing Azure VM connection -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of Azure NSG configuration showing management ports (64295, 64297) restricted to NetBird IP -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of Azure NSG configuration showing honeypot ports (22, 80, 443, etc.) open to Any -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of Let's Encrypt certificate configuration process -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of Kibana dashboard showing attack statistics -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of Attack Map visualization -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of top attacker countries and IPs -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of password/username word clouds -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert architecture diagram showing T-Pot with NetBird and Elastic Fleet integration -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert compliance checklist showing Azure terms and GDPR adherence -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of Elastic Fleet behavioral analysis of attack -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of NetBird access policies for honeypot management -->
<!-- PLACEHOLDER: Insert screenshot of Security Onion receiving logs from honeypot via NetBird -->
```

### Replacement Process
1. Capture screenshots with proper anonymization
2. Save with appropriate filenames
3. Replace placeholder comments with actual image references
4. Update documentation to reference new images
5. Verify all images are properly linked and displayed

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Screenshots
- Video demonstrations of key processes
- Interactive diagrams and visualizations
- Animated GIFs showing attack patterns
- 3D visualizations of network architecture

### Tools and Technologies
- **Screenshot Tools**: Use professional screenshot tools for high-quality captures
- **Image Editing**: Use image editing software for anonymization and enhancement
- **Diagram Tools**: Use professional diagramming tools for architecture diagrams
- **Visualization Tools**: Use data visualization tools for attack analysis
